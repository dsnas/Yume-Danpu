A lonely girl looks from her balcony to the busy streets below.

The cars make noise like a console's fans running a game as real as life, their destination unknown to her, but impending to them.

The girl is often filled with sonder as she watches the lights pass by. A festival of lives, each their own book, while her existence has felt like nothing more than an incomplete first draft. If only she had worn the face waiting for her in the jar by the door, only then would she have been able to join the celebration.

Life stitches its path for her not out of goodness, but out of pity. It is like a dream, and she drifts along without fully understanding, and yet this world still turns without her.

The lonely girl goes back to her warm room. It had always been her fantasy to escape forever into her own mind, the only safe space she could ever be in.

She lays on her bed and begins to dream, her consciousness fading into her own private reverie.

This is that dream.
