**[Yume Danpu](https://dsnas.itch.io/yume-danpu) is an open-source Yume Nikki fangame created in Brazil by dsans and migel8022.**  
This repository is updated regularly while we're working on it, not just when new versions are released.

## Development and release videos
We occasionally post videos on YouTube showcasing upcoming or newly released changes and features.  
If you want to see what we're doing next, check out [the playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_pzsGsbaRMXNumNYboPS_WFcR2NDsNUd)! I guess it would blow some of the surprises, though...

## Infrequently asked questions

### Why use GameMaker?
> I started using GameMaker back in 2021, so I've picked up a thing or two since then. Also, GameMaker gives us a lot more freedom to do whatever we want compared to RPG Maker 2003.

### Why is it open-source?
> During the development of version 0.02, the GameMaker project randomly got corrupted. That's when I decided to put the game on GitHub, since it makes backing up way faster and easier. I made the repository public because, well... **What Could Possibly Go Wrongâ„¢**? We'd be more than happy if someone used what we made to create something new, even though that's not really our Mango.
