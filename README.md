**[Yume Danpu](https://dsnas.itch.io/yume-danpu) is an open-source Yume Nikki fangame created in Brazil by dsans and migel8022.**  
This repository is updated regularly while we're working on it, not just when new versions are released.

### We strongly recommend playing the game first before searching for any secrets in the code, as they definitely aren’t hard to find. If a secret exists, there will ALWAYS be something to guide you to it. We would never hide an invisible door on one specific tree that looks just like the other three hundred around it. That would be really, really embarrassing, and completely unfair to you, the player.

&nbsp;

## Development and release videos
We occasionally post videos on YouTube showcasing upcoming or newly released changes and features.  
You can follow the game's progress through the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_pzsGsbaRMXNumNYboPS_WFcR2NDsNUd)!

## Infrequently asked questions

### Why use GameMaker to make the game?
> I started using GameMaker back in 2021, so I’ve picked up a few things since then. It also gives us a lot more freedom to do whatever we want compared to RPG Maker.

### Why make the game open-source?
> I put Yume Danpu on GitHub after the original GameMaker project randomly got corrupted. I made the repository public because, well, I figured, what the hell? We'd be more than happy if someone used what we made to create something new.
