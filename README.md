<h2><br>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Only two worlds to explore...?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Not one, but three types of collectibles you can find while exploring:</strong><ul>
    <li>Effects, strange eggs that give you a new body with special abilities.</li>
    <li>Items, ordinary objects that help you in some way, like a <strong>drivable go-kart</strong>.</li>
    <li>Themes, visual styles for menus. They are ultimately useless.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong>An original soundtrack by migel8022</strong> (not with just three-second loops!!)</li>
  <li><strong>Several customizable settings, with many more to come:</strong><ul>
    <li>Multiple languages (English, Brazilian Portuguese)</li>
    <li>Navigation and optimization (Fullscreen, Low Quality, Show FPS, etc.)</li>
    <li>Separate volume sliders (Music, Menu, Player, etc.)</li>
    <li>Accessibility option (Reduced Motion)</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong>A lot of monkeys. I really hope you like monkeys.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2><br>Development and devlogs</h2>
<p>Yume Danpu is currently in development by me, <b>dsans</b>, and <b>migel8022</b>. We update this repository even when we're not releasing a new version, but that's not really a good way to watch our progress. If you wanna see what we're doing next, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_pzsGsbaRMXNumNYboPS_WFcR2NDsNUd" target="_blank">our devlogs on YouTube</a>! Though I guess it'd give away too many surprises...</p>

<h2><br>Report a bug</h2>
Noticed anything that clearly wasn't supposed to happen? Fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/zZaioLfNXEoNXhyE7" target="_blank">this Google Form</a> to help us make the game a little less broken, please!! You'll win our hearts <3 (or, if you prefer, a place in the Special Thanks.)

<h2><br>Never asked questions</h2>
<h3>Is Yume Danpu associated with Yume Nikki?</h3>
<blockquote>No, it's purely a fan game.</blockquote>
<h3>Is anything else needed besides the .zip file?</h3>
<blockquote>No, GameMaker isn't like RPG Maker 2003.</blockquote>
<h3>Why open-source?</h3>
<blockquote>A shark plushie asked me to. I'm not sure why, though.</blockquote>
<h3>Why GameMaker instead of RPG Maker 2003?</h3>
<blockquote>GameMaker gives us a lot more freedom to do whatever we want compared to RPG Maker 2003.</blockquote>
<h3>Why do updates take so long?</h3>
<blockquote>I'm the only one actively making Yume Danpu.</blockquote>

<h6 align="center">The hardest part of having a lot of ideas is actually making them...</h6>
