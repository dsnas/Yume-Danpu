This repository is updated regularly while we're working on it, not just when new versions are released.

## Development and release videos
If you wanna see what we're doing next, check out [our devlog on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_pzsGsbaRMXNumNYboPS_WFcR2NDsNUd)! I guess it would blow some of the surprises, though...

## Never asked questions

### Why is it open-source?
> A shark plushie told me to. Not sure why, though.

### Why use GameMaker?
> GameMaker gives us a lot more freedom to do whatever we want compared to RPG Maker 2003.

### Does that mean the style will be completely different from Yume Nikki?
> Not really. The foundation will be the same but we'll *try* to innovate the rest, even if it takes a while. Also, I recently lost a monkey. If you find it can you please give it to me?
