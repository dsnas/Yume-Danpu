<p>
  Yume Danpu is currently in development by me, <b>dsans</b>, and <b>migel8022</b>, who made all the music.
  Also, this repository is updated regularly while we're working on it, not just when new versions are released.
</p>

<h2><br>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Only 3 worlds...?</strong> The next version will change that.</li>
  <li><strong>Not one, but three types of collectibles you can find while exploring:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Effects</strong>, magical eggs that give you a new body with special abilities. <i>(0)</i></li>
      <li><strong>Items</strong>, ordinary objects that help you in some way, like a <strong>drivable go-kart</strong>. <i>(1)</i></li>
      <li><strong>Themes</strong>, visual styles for menus. They are ultimately useless. <i>(3)</i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>An original soundtrack made entirely by migel8022!</strong> It even has tracks longer than three seconds!!</li>
</ul>

<h2><br>Never asked questions</h2>
<h3>Is Yume Danpu associated with Yume Nikki?</h3>
<blockquote>No, it's purely a fan game.</blockquote>
<h3>Is anything else needed besides the .zip file?</h3>
<blockquote>No, GameMaker isn't like RPG Maker 2003.</blockquote>
<h3>Why open-source?</h3>
<blockquote>A shark plushie asked me to. I'm not sure why, though.</blockquote>
<h3>Why GameMaker instead of RPG Maker 2003?</h3>
<blockquote>GameMaker gives us a lot more freedom to do whatever we want compared to RPG Maker 2003.</blockquote>
<h3>Why do updates take so long?</h3>
<blockquote>School and other life matters, and I'm the only one programming Yume Danpu.</blockquote>
