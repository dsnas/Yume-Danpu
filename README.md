<p>
  Yume Danpu is currently in development by me, dsans, and migel8022, who made all the music. Updates may take a while because of school or other life matters.
  Also, this repository is updated regularly while we're working on it, not just when new versions are released.
</p>

<h2><br>Featuring</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Only 3 worlds...?</strong> The next version will change that.</li>
  <li><strong>Not one, but three types of collectibles:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Effects</strong> are magical eggs you can eat to get a new body and abilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Items</strong> are ordinary objects that help you in some way, like a <strong>drivable go-kart</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Themes</strong> change the appearance of menus. They are ultimately useless.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><br>Never asked questions</h2>
<h3>Why is it open-source?</h3>
<blockquote>A shark plushie asked me to. Not sure why, though.</blockquote>
<h3>Why use GameMaker?</h3>
<blockquote>GameMaker gives us a lot more freedom to do whatever we want compared to RPG Maker 2003.</blockquote>
<h3>So the style is different from Yume Nikki?</h3>
<blockquote>No, but we're trying not to make more of the same.</blockquote>
<h3>Do I need to download anything besides the .zip file?</h3>
<blockquote>No, GameMaker runs beautifully on its own, unlike RPG Maker 2003.</blockquote>

  <br><br>Think the game is ugly? Yeah, we do too.
