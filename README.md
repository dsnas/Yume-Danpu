here it is, Yume Danpu's source code, which updates as I work on the game, not just when a new version is released.

**i strongly advise you to play the game first before searching for any secrets in the code, as they probably aren't that hard to find in-game. if a secret exists, there will
always be something to lead you to it. i would never hide an invisible door on one specific tree that looks just like the other three hundred around it.**

are you here to report a bug? you could just leave a comment on the itch.io page, stating where and how it happened. iâ€™m not really sure.
