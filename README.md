**[Yume Danpu](https://dsnas.itch.io/yume-danpu) is an open-source Yume Nikki fangame created in Brazil by dsans and migel8022.**  
This repository is updated regularly while we're working on it, not just when new versions are released.

### We strongly recommend playing the game first before searching for any secrets in the code, as they definitely arenâ€™t hard to find. If a secret exists, there will ALWAYS be something to guide you to it. We would never hide an invisible door on one specific tree that looks just like the other three hundred around it. That would be really, really embarrassing, and completely unfair to you, the player.

&nbsp;

## Development and release videos
We occasionally post videos on YouTube showcasing upcoming or newly released changes and features.  
Follow the game's progress through the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_pzsGsbaRMXNumNYboPS_WFcR2NDsNUd)!
